# Expo Camera: `takePictureAsync` error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The error typically occurs when attempting to take a picture before the camera component has fully loaded and initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

Calling `takePictureAsync` immediately after rendering the `Camera` component often leads to an error because the camera isn't yet ready.  The error message might vary but often indicates that the camera is unavailable or not initialized.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera has finished loading. This can be achieved by using the `Camera.isReady` property within a `useEffect` hook or other state management approach to ensure the camera is ready before attempting to take the picture.
